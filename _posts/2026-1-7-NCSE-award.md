Cosmo's PhD is part-funded by Butterfly Conservation and aims to develop fast and flexible methods for their data on butterflies and moths. Cosmo is supervised by me, Marek Grzes (Computing, Kent), Emily Dennis (Butterfly Conservation) and Byron Morgan (statistical ecology legend!).

The talk presented Cosmo's work on spatio-temporal neural networks for citizen science data.
