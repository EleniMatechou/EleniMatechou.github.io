I gave an invited talk at the 14ths Bayesian Nonparametric Conference, which took place at UCLA, June 23-27th, 2025

I presented work that I have done over the last decade with collaborators (see below for links to papers) on BNP methods for ecological data, and especially in modelling phenological patterns of populations using capture-recapture, count and batch-mark data.
