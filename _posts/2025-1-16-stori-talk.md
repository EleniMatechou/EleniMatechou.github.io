I was delighted to take part in the STOR-i Annual Conference 2025, held at Lancaster University on 9–10 January 2025. 

I gave a talk on Mixture Models for Ecological Data, including discussing the methods and results from:

Matechou, E., and Caron, F. (2017). Modelling individual migration patterns using a Bayesian
nonparametric approach for capture–recapture data. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 11(1), 21-40.

Diana, A., Matechou, E., Griffin, J., & Johnston, A. (2020). A hierarchical dependent Dirichlet process
prior for modelling bird migration patterns in the UK. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 14(1), 473-493.

Diana, A., Matechou, E., Griffin, J., Arnold, T., Tenan, S., & Volponi, S. (2023). A general modeling
framework for open wildlife populations based on the Pólya tree prior. Biometrics, 79(3), 2171-2183.

Rotous, I., Diana, A., & Matechou, E. (2025). A Pólya Tree modelling framework for batch-mark data. The Annals of Applied Statistics, 19(2), 1110-1126.
