My former PhD student and collaborator, Ioannis Rotous, announced winner of Young Biometrician Award 2025!



The statement from the YBA judging committee reads:

This paper presents a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework for analysing batch-mark data, where animals are marked in groups rather than uniquely, using a Pólya Tree prior on a latent entry–exit grid. The method enables exact and computationally efficient inference on population size and survival in open populations, scaling with the number of sampling occasions rather than individuals. Through simulation studies and two real-world ecological applications, the approach demonstrates clear advantages over existing approximate or computationally intensive models, providing a flexible and general framework for ecological monitoring.

The panel selected this paper for its methodological innovation and clear practical impact. Ioannis Rotous’s work offers a major advance in modelling complex ecological data, combining statistical rigour with real-world applicability. The paper stands out for its originality, technical depth, and strong applied relevance—qualities that make it a deserving recipient of the Young Biometrician Award.
